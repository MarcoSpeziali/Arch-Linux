Magnetic road
I′m an insect hypnotized by your glowing
I drive fast, speechless denuded

I'm facing this magnetic solitude

Oh, I′m getting bigger as the sun goes down
My shadow stretches slowly on the ground

Equal the eagle, the river, the child
Soon each of our shadows will unite as one
In concrete is the world that I am running from
Daylight is gone, I'm coming home

Magnetic road
Give me shelter to my dreams
Please give me back my self-esteem
Led astray by the moon
I'm riding on the edge of salvation

Oh, the air is thicker as the sun goes down
I′m watching the shadows growing on the ground

Equal the eagle, the river, the child
Soon each of their souls will echo in mine
Equal in the silence, revealing that throne
Daylight is gone, I′m going home

I'm going home
