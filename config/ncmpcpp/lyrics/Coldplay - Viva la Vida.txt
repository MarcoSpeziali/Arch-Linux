I know, I'm finding it hard to breathe
And I've been drowning in my own sleep
I feel a hate crashing over me
So rescue me
So rescue me

Everybody need to drive before we break out like hives
Gotta learn to put this s*** we call pride to the side,
I ain't no player, without you I'm not OJ
Viva la vida now she wanna give me Coldplay
Once you find you can't keep it
You broke my heart into million tiny little pieces
And now its purge on you, never put hurt on you
Talkin' to your girlfriends tryna find dirt on you
Damn, is this what we have come to?
When he was cheating I was the person you run to
Guess it's for another time this is what I've come to find
Should've seen this coming but Stevie Wonder
Love is blind

I know, I'm finding it hard to breathe
And I've been drowning in my own sleep
I feel a hate crashing over me
So rescue me
So rescue me

She used to be the person of my dreams
And now she's just a a demon of my nightmares
I know this s*** ain't what it seems
Hey, hey you ain't leavin', I'll be right here
Shorty just rescue me, I know you especially
The way I always felt with you
Thinking that true telepathy
Like the age and their games
We used to be blinding
Who would have thought that when you left
The right would become the wrong thing

I know, I'm finding it hard to breathe
And I've been drowning in my own sleep
I feel, A hate crashing over me
So rescue me
So rescue me

I know, I'm finding it hard to breathe
And I've been drowning in my own sleep
I feel a hate crashing over me
So rescue me
So rescue me
